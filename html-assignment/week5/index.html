    <h2>About Me</h2>

                My name is Charlene Staughton and this is my 1<sup>st</sup> website. I am a very passionate and <em>goal-oriented</em> individual. When I am curious about something I try to teach myself more about whatever it is. 
            After school, I want to do more traveling and make a photo journal of my travels. I would like to build a brand for myself. I would also be interested in working for a company like National Geographic. I have always been very interested in cameras. 
            I got my first camera when I was ten years old and have had a love for photography since. I enjoy exploring the different settings and features that my Cannon Rebel camera has. I am so excited to see what the future holds for me. 
            There is not limiting myself on what I can and can't do in life. When I put my mind to it, there is no stopping me. 
        
                As Jim Carrey once said:<blockquote>Maybe other people will try to limit me but I don't limit myself.
            <cite>-Jim Carrey</cite></blockquote>
        
                I am very excited to be in the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program. I look forward to developing new skills and challenging myself. I have some revelant experience in the field. 
            I have dabbled in Adobe programs like Photoshop and have created magazines and posters. I've done some work in videography and produced a few movie trailers with friends. I am currently learning how to perfect my skills in Adobe Illustrator which has been both challenging and a lot of fun. 
            So far, I have recieved positive feedback on the work I have done. This makes me proud of myself and motivated to create more. I enjoy starting new projects and thinking outside the box! I love to draw out my ideas with pencil and paper. This helps me collect all of my thoughts in one place and start my creative process.
